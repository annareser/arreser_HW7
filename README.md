a. This project was to create a website with a survey that is compliant with accesibility and inclusivity measures.

b. On this assignment, I wrote clear and concise instructions, labels, and avoided using jargon or technical language. This simple language makes it easy to understand for all users, regardless of their reading level or language proficiency. I used form fields that are easy to understand and use, and provided multiple ways to enter data, for example, dropdown menus, radio buttons, and checkboxes to reduce the need for typing.

I also used a high contrast color scheme and provide sufficient color contrast between the foreground and background to make the text readable for all users. I used a clear and legible font, and avoided using small font sizes. The web form can also be navigated and used with a keyboard alone by using the tab key, so there's no relying on a mouse or other pointing device. 

Lastly, I used language that avoids gender biases and acknowledges diversity. I provided a list of appropriate titles and salutations that users can choose from and can choose multiples of. I also offered an option for users to select "prefer not to answer" when asked for personal information such as gender or ethnicity.
